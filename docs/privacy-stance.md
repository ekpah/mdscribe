# Privacy Stance for OSS Deployments

This document defines the short-term privacy position for the open-source launch.

## Guidance

- **Cloud-hosted usage should not be treated as safe for sensitive patient PII/PHI** until stronger compliance controls are complete.
- **Self-hosting is recommended** for users who require full control over where data is processed and stored.

## Rationale

This guidance is intentionally risk-based and avoids absolute legal claims. It is meant to help teams assess deployment choices against their own compliance requirements and data sensitivity profiles.
