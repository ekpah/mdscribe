# MD-Scribe

This is a webapp to organize medical templates and use them in a doctors day-to-day work.

## Privacy & Hosting (OSS)

Our short-term privacy position for the open-source launch:

- Cloud-hosted usage should not be treated as safe for sensitive patient PII/PHI until stronger compliance controls are complete.
- Self-hosting is the recommended path for users who need full control over where data is processed and stored.

This guidance is risk-based and intended to help teams choose an appropriate deployment model for their data sensitivity.
